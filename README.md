# "Red ball ripoff" (working name)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
## About the project☀️
***Red ball ripoff*** is simple 2D physics-based platformer game, developed as a final project for uni classes.
The game is mostly intended to be released for mobile, but will also be available on my itch.io.

## Inspirations✨
The biggest inspiration for this game is an old flash game called ***Red ball***. It's a platformer, where the character is a rigid body, making movement a little more challenging. In the original game, there are 17 levels, each one introducing different mechanics, like spinning platforms, slopes, swaying axes, a car, a train and so on.

## Gameplay🕹️
Like in many other platformers, your goal is to pass all levels, by getting from point A to point B without dying, while collecting stuff on the way.
The one thing about my game that's different from the original, is that you will have to collect something, to unlock the next checkpoint.
